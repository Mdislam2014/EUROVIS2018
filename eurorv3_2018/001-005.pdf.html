      The Visual Analytics (VA) approach has become an important tool for
      gaining insights on various data sets. Thus, significant research has
      been conducted to integrate statistical methods in the interactive
      environment of VA where data visualization provides support to analysts
      in understanding and exploring the data. However, much of the data
      explored with VA is inherently uncertain due to limits of our knowledge
      about a phenomenon, randomness and indeterminism, and vagueness. The
      Bayesian Network (BN) is a graphical model that provides techniques for
      reasoning under conditions of uncertainty in a consistent and
      mathematically rigorous manner. While several software tools for
      visualizing and editing BNs exist, they have an evident shortcoming when
      spatial data. In this study, we propose a Visual Analytics-enabled BN
      approach for reasoning under uncertainty. We describe the implementation
      procedure using an example of heterogeneous data that includes locations
      of security surveillance cameras installed in public places.<br>
