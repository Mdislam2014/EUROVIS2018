      The Visual Analytics (VA) approach has become an important tool for
      gaining insights on various data sets. Thus, significant research has
      been conducted to integrate statistical methods in the interactive
      environment of VA where data visualization provides support to analysts
      in understanding and exploring the data. However, much of the data
      explored with VA is inherently uncertain due to limits of our knowledge
      about a phenomenon, randomness and indeterminism, and vagueness. The
      Bayesian Network (BN) is a graphical model that provides techniques for
      reasoning under conditions of uncertainty in a consistent and
      mathematically rigorous manner. While several software tools for
      visualizing and editing BNs exist, they have an evident shortcoming when
      spatial data. In this study, we propose a Visual Analytics-enabled BN
      approach for reasoning under uncertainty. We describe the implementation
      procedure using an example of heterogeneous data that includes locations
      of security surveillance cameras installed in public places.

      Visualizations of cultural heritage collections play an increasing role
      in supporting the sensemaking processes of visitors and researchers.
      While many visualization systems provide overview and exploration options
      for non-expert audiences or casual users, others support the in-depth
      analysis of collection experts like curators or art historians. These
      visualizations often rely on object metadata, which have been generated
      from historical catalogs or textual sources, each with their own
      standards of precision, certainty, and data quality. To make these levels
      of data quality transparent, the visualization of uncertainty poses a
      vital challenge for interfaces across the board. We introduce the
      PolyCube system as a visualization framework which provides four
      different perspectives on the geo-temporal origins of cultural collection
      data, including coordinated multiple views, animation, color coding, and
      a space-time cube representation. With specific regard to this
      multi-perspective framework we develop options to visualize
      spatio-temporal uncertainty and discuss ways and means of their coherent
      implementation.

      Radiotherapy is one of the most common treatment strategy for prostate
      cancer. Prior to radiotherapy, a complex process consisting of several
      steps is employed to create an optimal treatment plan. However, all these
      steps include several sources of uncertainty, which can be detrimental
      for the successful outcome of the treatment. In this work, we present a
      number of strategies from the field of Visual Analytics that have been
      recently designed and implemented, for the visualization of data,
      processes and uncertainties at each step of the planning pipeline. We
      additionally document our opinion on topics that have not been yet
      addressed, and could be interesting directions for future work.

    <div id='4' class="abstract">
      Uncertainty is usually technically defined with associated metrics by
      visualization researchers. Next to this rather objective description,
      there is a subjective notion to uncertainty considering human experiences
      eliciting a response to the perceived uncertainty. This article aims to
      complement the default technical notion with a subjective perspective of
      uncertainty as we experienced. As a starting point, we introduce a
      conceptual framework aiming to explain the consequential life-cycle of
      subjective uncertainty in relation with visualization methods. The
      framework is illustrated by a case in which the redundancy of logged game
      play behavior is visualized to assist the discovery of subjective
      uncertainty. Our preliminary results show that visualizing the Shannon
      entropy of categorical action labels can be a promising method to probe
      subjective uncertainty.

      Uncertainty in visualization is an inevitable issue for sensemaking in
      criminal intelligence. Accuracy and precision of adopted visualization
      techniques have got greater role in trustworthiness with the system while
      finding out insights from crime related dataset. In this paper, we have
      presented a case study to introduce concepts of uncertainty and
      provenance and their relevance to crime analysis. Our findings show how
      uncertainties of visualization pipeline influence cognitive biases, human
      awareness and trust-building during crime analysis and how provenance can
      enhance analysis processes that include uncertainties.
