      Uncertainty is usually technically defined with associated metrics by
      visualization researchers. Next to this rather objective description,
      there is a subjective notion to uncertainty considering human experiences
      eliciting a response to the perceived uncertainty. This article aims to
      complement the default technical notion with a subjective perspective of
      uncertainty as we experienced. As a starting point, we introduce a
      conceptual framework aiming to explain the consequential life-cycle of
      subjective uncertainty in relation with visualization methods. The
      framework is illustrated by a case in which the redundancy of logged game
      play behavior is visualized to assist the discovery of subjective
      uncertainty. Our preliminary results show that visualizing the Shannon
      entropy of categorical action labels can be a promising method to probe
      subjective uncertainty.<br>
