      Radiotherapy is one of the most common treatment strategy for prostate
      cancer. Prior to radiotherapy, a complex process consisting of several
      steps is employed to create an optimal treatment plan. However, all these
      steps include several sources of uncertainty, which can be detrimental
      for the successful outcome of the treatment. In this work, we present a
      number of strategies from the field of Visual Analytics that have been
      recently designed and implemented, for the visualization of data,
      processes and uncertainties at each step of the planning pipeline. We
      additionally document our opinion on topics that have not been yet
      addressed, and could be interesting directions for future work.<br>
