      Large mobile operators have to quickly react to mobile network failures
      to ensure service continuity and this task is a complex one, due to the
      continuous and very fast evolution of mobile networks: from 2G to 3G and
      onto LTE, each significant milestone in the mobile technology has
      increased the complexity of networks and services management. Failures
      must be promptly analyzed and sorted according to different prioritizing
      objectives, in order to devise suitable fix plans able to mitigate
      failures impact in terms of money loss or damaged reputation. This paper
      presents a visual analytics solution for supporting the failure
      management activities of TIM (Telecom Italia Group), the biggest Italian
      provider of telecommunications services with over 30M active mobile
      subscribers. The proposed system has been developed collaboratively by
      University of Rome ''La Sapienza'', Polytechnic of Turin, and TIM,
      analyzing the operators' requirements and viable optimization strategies
      for prioritizing interventions that rely on statistical data on mobile
      cells occupation, in order to identify the impact of failures in term of
      end users' connectivity.<br>
