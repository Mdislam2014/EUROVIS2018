      High-dimensional data poses a significant challenge for analysis, as
      patterns typically exist only in subsets of dimensions or records. A
      common approach to reveal patterns, such as meaningful structures or
      relationships, is to split the data and then to create a visual
      representation (views) for each data subset. This introduces the problem
      of ordering the views effectively because patterns can depend on the
      presented sequence. Existing methods provide metrics and heuristics to
      achieve an ordering of views based on their data characteristics.
      However, an effective ordering of subspace views is expected to rely on
      task- and data-dependent properties. Hence, heuristic-based ordering
      methods can be highly objective and not relevant to the task at hand,
      which is why the user involvement is key to find a meaningful ordering.
      We introduce a concept for a consensus-based ordering of views that
      learns to form sequences of subset views fitting the overall users'
      needs. This concept allows users to decide on the ordering freely and
      accumulates their preference into a global view that reflects the
      consensus. We showcase and discuss this concept based on ordering colored
      tiles from the controversially discussed rainbow color map.<br>
