      Understanding network activity and cyber threats is of major concern
      these days, for business and private users alike. As more and more online
      applications assist us in our daily life, there is a growing potential
      vulnerability to cyber crime. With this paper, we want to share our
      vision of cyber security analytics becoming an accessible everyday task
      through visual analysis tools. We describe the context of this vision and
      our experience with the first achievements in this direction. With our
      new prototype, anyone can analyze their network traffic logs and get
      security-relevant information out of it, a task that was too difficult
      and sometimes too expensive in the past. We present an open, accessible
      and user-friendly visual network analyzer for PCAP (packet capture)
      files, critically discuss our first prototype, and give an outlook to
      anomaly detection supported by active learning in this context.<br>
