      Solving a predictive analytics problem involves multiple machine learning
      tasks in a workflow. Directing such workflows efficiently requires an
      understanding of data so as to identify and handle missing values and
      outliers, compute feature correlations and to select appropriate models
      and hyper-parameters. While traditional machine learning techniques are
      capable of handling these challenges to a certain extent, visual analysis
      of data and results at each stage can significantly assist in optimal
      processing of the workflow. We present iFuseML , a visual interactive
      framework to support analysts in machine learning workflows via
      insightful data visualizations as well as natural language interfaces
      where appropriate. Our platform lets the user intuitively search and
      explore datasets, join relevant datasets using natural language queries,
      detect and visualize multidimensional outliers and explore feature
      relationships using Bayesian coordinated views. We also demonstrate how
      visualization assists in comparing prediction errors to guide ensemble
      models so as to generate more accurate predictions. We illustrate our
      framework using a house price dataset from Kaggle, where using iFuseML
      simplified the machine learning workflow and helped improve the resulting
      prediction accuracy.<br>
