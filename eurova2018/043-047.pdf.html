      Recently, predictive policing has gained a lot of attention, as the
      benefits, e.g., better crime prevention or an optimized resource planning
      are essential goals for law enforcement agencies. Commercial predictive
      policing systems commonly visualize predictions on maps but provide only
      little support for human analysts in the technical and methodological
      processes that constitute corresponding implementations. In this paper,
      we report on a project of bringing visual analytics to the field of
      predictive policing. We introduce a process model that includes machine
      learning as well as visualization and has been developed together with
      experts from a law enforcement agency. We also showcase a visual
      analytics tool, called polimaps, that is part of a real-world predictive
      policing project and implements elements of the proposed process.<br>
