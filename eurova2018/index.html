      This paper introduces ComModeler, a novel approach for topic modeling
      using community finding in dynamic networks. Our algorithm first extracts
      the terms/keywords, formulates a network of collocated terms, then
      refines the network based on various features (such as term/relationship
      frequency, sudden changes in their frequency time series, or vertex
      betweenness centrality) to reveal the structures/communities in dynamic
      social networks. These communities correspond to different hidden topics
      in the input text documents. Although initially motivated to analyze text
      documents, we soon realized the ComModeler has more general implications
      for other application domains. We demonstrate the ComModeler on several
      real-world datasets, including the IEEE VIS publications from 1990 to
      2016, together with collocated phrases obtained from various political
      blogs.

      We present a visual analytical approach to exploring variation of topic
      popularity in social media (such as Twitter) over space and time. Our
      approach includes an analytical pipeline and a multi-view visualization
      tool. As attempts of topic extraction from very short texts like tweets
      may not produce meaningful results, we aggregate the texts prior to
      applying topic modelling techniques. Interactive visualisations support
      detection of burst events in social media posting activities at different
      locations, show the spatial, temporal, quantitative, and semantic aspects
      of these events, and enable the user to explore how popularity of topics
      varies over cities and time. A case study has been conducted using a
      real-world tweet dataset.

      Solving a predictive analytics problem involves multiple machine learning
      tasks in a workflow. Directing such workflows efficiently requires an
      understanding of data so as to identify and handle missing values and
      outliers, compute feature correlations and to select appropriate models
      and hyper-parameters. While traditional machine learning techniques are
      capable of handling these challenges to a certain extent, visual analysis
      of data and results at each stage can significantly assist in optimal
      processing of the workflow. We present iFuseML , a visual interactive
      framework to support analysts in machine learning workflows via
      insightful data visualizations as well as natural language interfaces
      where appropriate. Our platform lets the user intuitively search and
      explore datasets, join relevant datasets using natural language queries,
      detect and visualize multidimensional outliers and explore feature
      relationships using Bayesian coordinated views. We also demonstrate how
      visualization assists in comparing prediction errors to guide ensemble
      models so as to generate more accurate predictions. We illustrate our
      framework using a house price dataset from Kaggle, where using iFuseML
      simplified the machine learning workflow and helped improve the resulting
      prediction accuracy.

      Guidance methods have the potential of bringing considerable benefits to
      Visual Analytics (VA), alleviating the burden on the user and allowing a
      positive analysis outcome. However, the boundary between conventional VA
      approaches and guidance is not sharply defined. As a consequence, framing
      existing guidance methods is complicated and the development of new
      approaches is also compromised. In this paper, we try to bring these
      concepts in order, defining clearer boundaries between guidance and
      no-guidance. We summarize our findings in form of a decision tree that
      allows scientists and designers to easily frame their solutions. Finally,
      we demonstrate the usefulness of our findings by applying our guideline
      to a set of published approaches.

      Large mobile operators have to quickly react to mobile network failures
      to ensure service continuity and this task is a complex one, due to the
      continuous and very fast evolution of mobile networks: from 2G to 3G and
      onto LTE, each significant milestone in the mobile technology has
      increased the complexity of networks and services management. Failures
      must be promptly analyzed and sorted according to different prioritizing
      objectives, in order to devise suitable fix plans able to mitigate
      failures impact in terms of money loss or damaged reputation. This paper
      presents a visual analytics solution for supporting the failure
      management activities of TIM (Telecom Italia Group), the biggest Italian
      provider of telecommunications services with over 30M active mobile
      subscribers. The proposed system has been developed collaboratively by
      University of Rome ''La Sapienza'', Polytechnic of Turin, and TIM,
      analyzing the operators' requirements and viable optimization strategies
      for prioritizing interventions that rely on statistical data on mobile
      cells occupation, in order to identify the impact of failures in term of
      end users' connectivity.

      We present an interactive visual music classification tool that will
      allow users to automatically structure music collections in a
      personalized way. With our approach, users play an active role in an
      iterative process of building classification models, using different
      interactive interfaces for labeling songs. The interactive tool conflates
      interfaces for the detailed analysis at different granularities, i.e.,
      audio features, music songs, as well as classification results at a
      glance. Interactive labeling is provided with three complementary
      interfaces, combining model-centered and human-centered labeling-support
      principles. A clean visual design of the individual interfaces depicts
      complex model characteristics for experts, and indicates our
      work-inprogress towards the abilities of non-experts. The result of a
      preliminary usage scenario shows that, with our system, hardly any
      knowledge about machine learning is needed to create classification
      models of high accuracy with less than 50 labels.

      This paper explores how a set-based visual analytics approach could be
      useful for analyzing customers' shopping behavior, and makes three main
      contributions. First, it describes the scale and characteristics of a
      real-world retail dataset from a major supermarket. Second, it presents a
      scalable visual analytics workflow to quickly identify patterns in
      shopping behavior. To assess the workflow, we conducted a case study that
      used data from four convenience stores and provides several insights
      about customers' shopping behavior. Third, from our experience with
      analyzing real-world retail data and comments made by our industry
      partner, we outline four research challenges for visual analytics to
      tackle large set intersection problems.

      Recently, predictive policing has gained a lot of attention, as the
      benefits, e.g., better crime prevention or an optimized resource planning
      are essential goals for law enforcement agencies. Commercial predictive
      policing systems commonly visualize predictions on maps but provide only
      little support for human analysts in the technical and methodological
      processes that constitute corresponding implementations. In this paper,
      we report on a project of bringing visual analytics to the field of
      predictive policing. We introduce a process model that includes machine
      learning as well as visualization and has been developed together with
      experts from a law enforcement agency. We also showcase a visual
      analytics tool, called polimaps, that is part of a real-world predictive
      policing project and implements elements of the proposed process.

      For the automatic segmentation of multivariate time series domain experts
      at first need to consider a huge space of alternative configurations of
      algorithms and parameters. We assume that only a small subset of these
      configurations needs to be computed and analyzed to lead users to
      meaningful configurations. To expedite this search, we propose the
      conceptualization of a segmentation workflow. First, with an algorithmic
      segmentation pipeline, domain experts can calculate segmentation results
      with different parameter configurations. Second, in an interactive visual
      analysis step, domain experts can explore segmentation results to further
      adapt and improve segmentation pipeline in an informed way. In the
      interactive analysis approach influences of algorithms, parameters, and
      different types of uncertainty information are conveyed, which is
      decisive to trigger selective and purposeful re-calculations. The
      workflow is built upon reflections on collaborations with domain experts
      working in activity recognition, which also defines our usage scenario
      demonstrating the applicability of the workflow.

      Understanding network activity and cyber threats is of major concern
      these days, for business and private users alike. As more and more online
      applications assist us in our daily life, there is a growing potential
      vulnerability to cyber crime. With this paper, we want to share our
      vision of cyber security analytics becoming an accessible everyday task
      through visual analysis tools. We describe the context of this vision and
      our experience with the first achievements in this direction. With our
      new prototype, anyone can analyze their network traffic logs and get
      security-relevant information out of it, a task that was too difficult
      and sometimes too expensive in the past. We present an open, accessible
      and user-friendly visual network analyzer for PCAP (packet capture)
      files, critically discuss our first prototype, and give an outlook to
      anomaly detection supported by active learning in this context.

      High-dimensional data poses a significant challenge for analysis, as
      patterns typically exist only in subsets of dimensions or records. A
      common approach to reveal patterns, such as meaningful structures or
      relationships, is to split the data and then to create a visual
      representation (views) for each data subset. This introduces the problem
      of ordering the views effectively because patterns can depend on the
      presented sequence. Existing methods provide metrics and heuristics to
      achieve an ordering of views based on their data characteristics.
      However, an effective ordering of subspace views is expected to rely on
      task- and data-dependent properties. Hence, heuristic-based ordering
      methods can be highly objective and not relevant to the task at hand,
      which is why the user involvement is key to find a meaningful ordering.
      We introduce a concept for a consensus-based ordering of views that
      learns to form sequences of subset views fitting the overall users'
      needs. This concept allows users to decide on the ordering freely and
      accumulates their preference into a global view that reflects the
      consensus. We showcase and discuss this concept based on ordering colored
      tiles from the controversially discussed rainbow color map.
