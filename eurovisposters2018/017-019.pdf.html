      Sparklines are placed in documents but their usability is rarely
      evaluated in their immediate context of paragraphs of text. We conducted
      an eye-tracking study to measure readability and understandability of
      four different conditions: two different sparkline chart types (bar and
      line charts) and two text languages (native and non-native languages). We
      found out that most participants out of 296 in total were not distracted
      by sparklines. Only 3.19% of the average reading time was spent looking
      at sparklines. There was no correlation between dwell time and data
      understanding, measured in a post-experiment quiz. The chart types did
      not have a significant effect on sparkline attention. However, compared
      with native textual context, sparklines in non-native text were more
      noticeable. The results of this study can be useful for future sparkline
      usage consideration.<br>
