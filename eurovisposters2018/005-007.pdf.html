      Information retrieval provides to date effective methods to search for
      documents relevant to user queries, and to support exploration of
      clusters of similar documents. Typically, the retrieval relies on
      text-based queries and similarity functions. However, in many cases also
      visual content is important in documents, for example, in the
      visualization field. There, researchers may want to search for papers
      based on similar example visualizations, which is difficult by relying on
      keyword search alone. We present a concept to automatically label
      visualization types in research papers and search for similar images,
      relying on state of the art image descriptors. We created a prototype
      that allows to search for papers showing images similar to a query image.
      Preliminary results of applying it on a corpus of VAST papers indicate
      the chosen descriptors can retrieve papers with similar images. Our
      approach for image-based search can complement text-based search and in
      perspective, support document corpus exploration based on clustering
      contained images. In future work, we want to explore if image-based
      search can also support the formation of taxonomies of a corpus or
      research papers, based on image similarity.<br>
