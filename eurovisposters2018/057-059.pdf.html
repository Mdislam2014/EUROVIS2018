      This poster abstract presents a visual comparison between three
      hand-drawn and one machine-generated human metabolic pathway diagrams.
      The human metabolic pathways, which describe significant biochemical
      reactions in the human body, have been increasingly investigated due to
      the development of analysis processes and are compiled into pathway
      diagrams to provide an overview of reaction in human body. This complex
      network includes about 5,000 metabolites and 7,500 reactions, which are
      hierarchically nested and difficult to visualize. We collect and analyze
      well-known human metabolic pathway diagrams, and summarize the design
      choices of these diagrams, respectively. Together with a
      machine-generated diagram, we can understand the visual complexity of
      three hand-drawn and one machine-generated diagrams.<br>
