      Many households share the objective of reducing electricity consumption
      for either economic or ecological motivations. Ecofeedback technologies
      support this objective by providing users with a visualization of their
      consumption. However as pointed out by several studies, users encounter
      difficulties in finding concrete actions to reduce their consumption. To
      overcome this limitation, we introduce in this paper Activelec, a system
      based on the visualization and interaction with user's behavior rather
      than raw consumption data. The user's behavior is modeled as the set of
      actions modifying the state of appliances over time. A key novelty of our
      solution is its focus on the What if approach applied to eco-feedback.
      Users can analyze and experiment scenarios by selecting and modifying
      their usage of electrical appliances over time and visualize the impact
      on the consumption. We conduct two user studies that evaluate the
      usability of Activelec and the relevance of the What if approach for
      electricity consumption. Our results show that users understand the
      interaction paradigm and can easily find relevant modifications in their
      usage of appliances. Moreover participants judge these changes of
      behavior would require little effort to be adopted. Therefore our work
      opens new perspectives on using the What if approach in the context of
      eco-feedback technology.<br>
