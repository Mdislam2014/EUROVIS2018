      Traditional analyses of geoscientific data and their features require a
      lot of manual scripting to organize various tools and software libraries.
      We present a tool developed to cover the typical workflow of the task of
      analyzing dependencies between regions of the climate system. We propose
      an interactive visual analysis tool that uses a series of automated
      analysis steps combined with an interactive visual exploration of
      patterns in the data. We base our analysis on the statistical approach of
      strongest negative correlations for discovery of teleconnections. The
      interactive visual analysis process uses selecting, highlighting, and
      filtering in four coordinated views. The views represent teleconnectivity
      information within a teleconnectivity map and a teleconnectivity links
      list as well as correlation information within a correlation map and a
      projection view of the correlation space. We apply the tool to different
      datasets to demonstrate its capabilities for the analysis and comparison
      of correlation patterns.<br>
