      We present an approach to highly responsive and interactive web-based 3D
      meteorological visualization. We describe important technical aspects of
      the current proof-of-concept implementation that leverages a 3D rendering
      farm. The work has been motivated by high demands of operational weather
      forecasters on ease of use of such a tool, quick system responsiveness
      and low operational end-to-end latency, instantaneous navigation in
      forecast-time (max. 5 seconds to navigate over 50 timesteps), and other
      challenging requirements considering the meteo data volumes and
      complexity of 3D visualization processing. We had limited computer
      resources but were allowed to spend any time needed in the back-end
      processing to maximize the responsiveness of the front-end (web-portal).
      Our goal was not to implement a perfect system, but to design a suitable
      architecture and implement a responsive system filled with 2D and 3D
      visualization products of operational NWP (numerical weather prediction)
      model runs for testing by forecasters and discovering good use-cases for
      3D in operations. We succeed in bringing conventional 2D and 3D
      visualizations together in one web-portal. Customized visualizations
      layouts can be created to depict a certain atmospheric phenomenon. The
      webportal provides display of all 3D products (pre-rendered) also as VR
      (virtual reality) images through the web-browser. The user can
      instantaneously rotate the camera-view on 3D products and rotate the
      vertical cross-sections in the web-browser. The system when used on a 3D
      high-end workstation with VR display provides fully interactive VR data
      exploration of any given 3D visualization product shown in the 3D preview
      in the web-portal. Although from today&rsquo;s perspective (modern
      browsers, Web-GL and cloud 3D computing/visualization technologies) our
      approach of rigorously pre-rendering 3D products might seem unnecessary,
      the contrary is true. The pre-rendered 3D views off-line in back-end
      (pre-caching) make sure the user will not suffer a poor web-portal
      responsiveness on-line.<br>
