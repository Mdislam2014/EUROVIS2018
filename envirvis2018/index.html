      Traditional analyses of geoscientific data and their features require a
      lot of manual scripting to organize various tools and software libraries.
      We present a tool developed to cover the typical workflow of the task of
      analyzing dependencies between regions of the climate system. We propose
      an interactive visual analysis tool that uses a series of automated
      analysis steps combined with an interactive visual exploration of
      patterns in the data. We base our analysis on the statistical approach of
      strongest negative correlations for discovery of teleconnections. The
      interactive visual analysis process uses selecting, highlighting, and
      filtering in four coordinated views. The views represent teleconnectivity
      information within a teleconnectivity map and a teleconnectivity links
      list as well as correlation information within a correlation map and a
      projection view of the correlation space. We apply the tool to different
      datasets to demonstrate its capabilities for the analysis and comparison
      of correlation patterns.

      We present an approach to highly responsive and interactive web-based 3D
      meteorological visualization. We describe important technical aspects of
      the current proof-of-concept implementation that leverages a 3D rendering
      farm. The work has been motivated by high demands of operational weather
      forecasters on ease of use of such a tool, quick system responsiveness
      and low operational end-to-end latency, instantaneous navigation in
      forecast-time (max. 5 seconds to navigate over 50 timesteps), and other
      challenging requirements considering the meteo data volumes and
      complexity of 3D visualization processing. We had limited computer
      resources but were allowed to spend any time needed in the back-end
      processing to maximize the responsiveness of the front-end (web-portal).
      Our goal was not to implement a perfect system, but to design a suitable
      architecture and implement a responsive system filled with 2D and 3D
      visualization products of operational NWP (numerical weather prediction)
      model runs for testing by forecasters and discovering good use-cases for
      3D in operations. We succeed in bringing conventional 2D and 3D
      visualizations together in one web-portal. Customized visualizations
      layouts can be created to depict a certain atmospheric phenomenon. The
      webportal provides display of all 3D products (pre-rendered) also as VR
      (virtual reality) images through the web-browser. The user can
      instantaneously rotate the camera-view on 3D products and rotate the
      vertical cross-sections in the web-browser. The system when used on a 3D
      high-end workstation with VR display provides fully interactive VR data
      exploration of any given 3D visualization product shown in the 3D preview
      in the web-portal. Although from today&rsquo;'s perspective (modern
      browsers, Web-GL and cloud 3D computing/visualization technologies) our
      approach of rigorously pre-rendering 3D products might seem unnecessary,
      the contrary is true. The pre-rendered 3D views off-line in back-end
      (pre-caching) make sure the user will not suffer a poor web-portal
      responsiveness on-line.

      Operational weather forecasters face the challenge of having to process
      and interpret a large amount of available information. Therefore,
      condensation of extensive information is required. Research and
      development of forecasting techniques will on the one hand improve the
      forecast quality and on the other hand lead to an increased amount of
      data. A new extensive and valuable data set will emerge from the SINFONY
      project at Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD). It aims at a seamless forecast
      of upcoming convective events from actual time up to some hours by
      combining observation-based nowcasting techniques and numerical weather
      prediction (NWP) ensembles into a single system. In this context, a group
      of products will comprise features ("cell objects") that were extracted
      from three-dimensional radar measurements and NWP ensemble simulations. A
      user-oriented intuitive visualization of the new meteorological data is
      crucial for weather warning and forecasting. Before including new data
      into forecast operation, extensive tests and evaluations have to be
      performed. It therefore requires a careful iterative development process
      with continuous evaluation by the users. To facilitate this process, an
      initial visualization mock-up is created, which will be used to prototype
      and refine visualization and data product concepts. The browser-based
      nature of the tool allows to quickly share an interactive design with the
      users which, in turn, will help to have in-depth discussions and to
      collect visualization requirements, before the final concept is
      implemented into the meteorological workstation. This paper presents the
      first use-case for this approach: The development of a concept to
      visualize object-based severe convective events based on matching
      observed and simulated features.

      The detection and analysis of mesoscale ocean eddies is a complex task,
      made more difficult when simulated or observational ocean data are
      massive. We present the statistical approach of change point detection as
      a means to help scientists efficiently extract relevant scientific
      information. We demonstrate the value of change point detection for the
      characterization of eddy behavior in simulated ocean data. Our results
      show that change point detection helps with the identification of
      significant parameter values used in an algorithm or determination of
      time points that correspond to eddy activity of interest.

      Water plays a critical role in our living and manufacturing activities.
      The continuously growing exploitation of water over the aquifer poses a
      risk for over-extraction and pollution, leading to many negative effects
      on land irrigation. Therefore, predicting aquifer water level accurately
      is urgently important, which can help us prepare water demands ahead of
      time. In this study, we employ the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model to
      predict the saturated thickness of an aquifer in the Southern High Plains
      Aquifer System in Texas, and exploit TensorBoard as a guide for model
      configurations. The Root Mean Squared Error of this study shows that the
      LSTM model can provide a good prediction capability using multiple data
      sources, and provides a good visualization tool to help us understand and
      evaluate the model configuration.

      Exploratory data visualization, an idea proposed by Tukey in 1977, is
      meant to output various types of visualization in order to make the data
      more understandable. While visualization researchers have generated many
      novel solutions to critical and complex environmental problems, to
      everyday environmental consultants, some practical considerations have to
      be made in the visualization analysis to help stakeholders generate and
      test hypotheses that would not be possible otherwise. We present two
      environmental case studies of using visualization to communicate key
      findings: constructing stratigraphic units (layered) and generating
      groundwater contaminant plumes (volumetric). These real-world cases show
      that many times visualization alone may not give us correct answers;
      often what works is the combination of visualization, domain experts'
      knowledge, and interpretation of the visualization solutions. The lack of
      any of them may lead to faulty conclusions. The first case study
      illustrates together how domain experts, visualization, and contamination
      conditions assisted in interpreting limited and ambiguous lithologic
      data. The second case study emphasizes conceptual and technical
      understanding and discusses some common factors affecting 3D
      interpolation, which again suggests that we must incorporate domain
      experts' knowledge as well as analytics into visualization for defensible
      decision making.

      The GlobalTreeSearch database provides a mapping between 60,065 tree
      species known to science and the countries where these trees grow. TreeeX
      is a visual exploration system that supports multifaceted analyses of the
      GlobalTreeSearch data. Focusing on the entire earth or a group of
      countries, investigating research questions on biodiversity are visually
      supported by interactive choropleth maps that color countries according
      to frequency, diversity, or uniqueness of prevalent tree species.
      Focusing on a single country, similarities and differences to other
      countries can be analyzed in detail. Several examples outline the
      system's capability of delivering insights concerning the geographical
      diversity of tree species.

      Urbanization is an increasing global trend resulting in a strong increase
      in public and individual transportation needs. Accordingly, a major
      challenge for traffic and urban planners is the design of sustainable
      mobility concepts to maintain and increase the long-term health of humans
      by reducing environmental pollution. Recent developments in sensor
      technology allow the precise tracking of vehicle sensor information,
      allowing a closer and more in-depth analysis of traffic data. We propose
      a visual analytics system for the exploration of environmental factors in
      these high-resolution and high-dimensional mobility sensor data.
      Additionally, we introduce an interactive visual logging approach to
      enable experts to cope with complex interactive analysis processes and
      the problem of the reproducibility of results. The usefulness of our
      approach is demonstrated via two expert studies with two domain experts
      from the field of environment-related projects and urban traffic
      planning.

      Many households share the objective of reducing electricity consumption
      for either economic or ecological motivations. Ecofeedback technologies
      support this objective by providing users with a visualization of their
      consumption. However as pointed out by several studies, users encounter
      difficulties in finding concrete actions to reduce their consumption. To
      overcome this limitation, we introduce in this paper Activelec, a system
      based on the visualization and interaction with user's behavior rather
      than raw consumption data. The user's behavior is modeled as the set of
      actions modifying the state of appliances over time. A key novelty of our
      solution is its focus on the What if approach applied to eco-feedback.
      Users can analyze and experiment scenarios by selecting and modifying
      their usage of electrical appliances over time and visualize the impact
      on the consumption. We conduct two user studies that evaluate the
      usability of Activelec and the relevance of the What if approach for
      electricity consumption. Our results show that users understand the
      interaction paradigm and can easily find relevant modifications in their
      usage of appliances. Moreover participants judge these changes of
      behavior would require little effort to be adopted. Therefore our work
      opens new perspectives on using the What if approach in the context of
      eco-feedback technology.
