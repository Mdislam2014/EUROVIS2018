      Operational weather forecasters face the challenge of having to process
      and interpret a large amount of available information. Therefore,
      condensation of extensive information is required. Research and
      development of forecasting techniques will on the one hand improve the
      forecast quality and on the other hand lead to an increased amount of
      data. A new extensive and valuable data set will emerge from the SINFONY
      project at Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD). It aims at a seamless forecast
      of upcoming convective events from actual time up to some hours by
      combining observation-based nowcasting techniques and numerical weather
      prediction (NWP) ensembles into a single system. In this context, a group
      of products will comprise features ("cell objects") that were extracted
      from three-dimensional radar measurements and NWP ensemble simulations. A
      user-oriented intuitive visualization of the new meteorological data is
      crucial for weather warning and forecasting. Before including new data
      into forecast operation, extensive tests and evaluations have to be
      performed. It therefore requires a careful iterative development process
      with continuous evaluation by the users. To facilitate this process, an
      initial visualization mock-up is created, which will be used to prototype
      and refine visualization and data product concepts. The browser-based
      nature of the tool allows to quickly share an interactive design with the
      users which, in turn, will help to have in-depth discussions and to
      collect visualization requirements, before the final concept is
      implemented into the meteorological workstation. This paper presents the
      first use-case for this approach: The development of a concept to
      visualize object-based severe convective events based on matching
      observed and simulated features.<br>
