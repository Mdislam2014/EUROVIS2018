      Exploratory data visualization, an idea proposed by Tukey in 1977, is
      meant to output various types of visualization in order to make the data
      more understandable. While visualization researchers have generated many
      novel solutions to critical and complex environmental problems, to
      everyday environmental consultants, some practical considerations have to
      be made in the visualization analysis to help stakeholders generate and
      test hypotheses that would not be possible otherwise. We present two
      environmental case studies of using visualization to communicate key
      findings: constructing stratigraphic units (layered) and generating
      groundwater contaminant plumes (volumetric). These real-world cases show
      that many times visualization alone may not give us correct answers;
      often what works is the combination of visualization, domain experts'
      knowledge, and interpretation of the visualization solutions. The lack of
      any of them may lead to faulty conclusions. The first case study
      illustrates together how domain experts, visualization, and contamination
      conditions assisted in interpreting limited and ambiguous lithologic
      data. The second case study emphasizes conceptual and technical
      understanding and discusses some common factors affecting 3D
      interpolation, which again suggests that we must incorporate domain
      experts' knowledge as well as analytics into visualization for defensible
      decision making.<br>
